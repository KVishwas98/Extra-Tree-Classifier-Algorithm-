# Extra-Tree-Classifier-Algorithm-
## Extra Tree Classifier Algorithm with with Credit Risk Dataset

## Aim:

THe main aim of this project is to explore the dataset and discuss some interesting observation through Extra Tree Classifier Algorithm and predict the output including all the indepenant variables and define and extract only variables which put in and affect the dependent variable.


## Dataset:

The dataset contains all available data for more than 900 rows of containing details of consumer's credit history, whether he/she is married/single, Education and so on. Dataset is available in case you desire to explore. Datasets in .CSV format.

# Model:
i) I have used Extra Tree Classifier Algorithm
